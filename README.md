# Ontology repository (LEDS project, ASP-F group)

This repository is part of the work of the [ASP-F](http://www.leds-projekt.de/de/arbeitspakete.html#asp-f---vernetzte-e-government-dienste) group from the [LEDS project](http://www.leds-projekt.de/) (in German). We want to plan, discuss and develop our ontologies publicly, therefore a repository on Github.

## Ontologies

We are working on the following ontologies. Each one is considered a so called domain ontology and describes a certain area of interest. Further ontology types are core ontologies (or vocabularies) such as Dublin Core and task ontologies, which contain additional facts and rules, to modify a certain domain on behalf of an application.

### Building ontology

This ontology describes buildings, usually structures which contain at least two rooms and a roof. We wanted to keep it simple, but the main focus lies on architectural facts.

### Elevator ontology

This ontology describes elevators inside or outside a building.

## License

We didn't decide the license yet, so if you consider using these ontologies, ask us and we find a solution.
