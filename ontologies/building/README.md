# Building ontology

This ontology describes buildings, usually structures which contain at least two rooms and a roof. We wanted to keep it simple, but the main focus lies on architectural facts.

## Acknowledgements

The building ontology is inspired and based on ideas of M. Goetz and A. Zipf (Related paper: [Extending OpenStreetMap to Indoor Environment: Bringing Volunteered Geographic Information to the Next Level](http://koenigstuhl.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/publications/2011/Goetz/Goetz-Zipf_2011_IndoorOSM.pdf))
