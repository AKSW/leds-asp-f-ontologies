# Building ontology

This ontology describes buildings, usually structures which contain at least two rooms and a roof. We wanted to keep it simple, but the main focus lies on architectural facts.

## Acknowledgements

The building ontology is partly inspired and based on ideas of M. Goetz and A. Zipf (Related paper: [Extending OpenStreetMap to Indoor Environment: Bringing Volunteered Geographic Information to the Next Level](http://koenigstuhl.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/publications/2011/Goetz/Goetz-Zipf_2011_IndoorOSM.pdf)). We kept the focus on architectural information and included elements from the following vocabularies:

* [Dublin Core](http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/)
* [The vocabulary for (L)OD description of wheelchair accessibility](http://semweb.mmlab.be/ns/wa#)
* [SKOS](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#)
