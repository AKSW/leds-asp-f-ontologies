# Measurement ontology

This ontology contains basic concepts of measurements e.g. width or length to express a certain value. It should be used together with unit information from the [Unit ontology](https://github.com/AKSW/leds-asp-f-ontologies/blob/master/ontologies/unit) to express information such as: this door has a `width` of `0.8 m`.

## Illustration
