# Building ontology

This ontology describes buildings, usually structures which contain at least two rooms and a roof. We wanted to keep it simple, but the main focus lies on architectural facts.

## Acknowledgements

The building ontology is partly inspired and based on ideas of M. Goetz and A. Zipf (Related paper: [Extending OpenStreetMap to Indoor Environment: Bringing Volunteered Geographic Information to the Next Level](http://koenigstuhl.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/publications/2011/Goetz/Goetz-Zipf_2011_IndoorOSM.pdf)).

Besides this, we added properties and classes to describe a building under the viewpoint of disability. That means, that information about elevator, toilet and so on regarding information which are essential for disabled people. But we kept the focus on architectural information without using disability specific terms. We included elements from the following vocabularies:

* [Dublin Core](http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/)
* [The vocabulary for (L)OD description of wheelchair accessibility](http://semweb.mmlab.be/ns/wa#)
* [SKOS](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#)
