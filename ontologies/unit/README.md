# Unit ontology

1. simple unit.ttl
2. test-measurement.ttl, test-unit.ttl, test-quantity.ttl

## versions

There are currently two versions the unit ontology. A simple one and a little more complex one that adopts an ontology that is used on BioPortal. 
Both versions are easy to use. The simpler version is uses unit as DatatypeProperties. The complexer version categorizes the measures and uses an quantity object to connect the value and the unit. Units are given seperatly.
